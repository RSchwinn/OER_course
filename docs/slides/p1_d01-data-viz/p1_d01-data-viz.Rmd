# Exploratory data analysis

---

## What is EDA?

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an aproach to analyzing data sets to summarize its main characteristics.

- Often, this is visual. That's what we're focusing on today.

- But we might also calculate summary statistics and perform data wrangling/manipulation/transformation at (or before) this stage of the 
analysis. That's what we'll focus on on Thursday.

# Data visualization

---

## Data visualization

> *"The simple graph has brought more information to the data analyst’s mind than any other device." — John Tukey*

- Data visualization is the creation and study of the visual representation of data.

- There are many tools for visualizing data (R is one of them), and many approaches/systems within R for making data visualizations (**ggplot2** is one of them, and that's the one we're going to use).

---

## ggplot2, part of the tidyverse

- ggplot2 is a data visualization package, that is part of the tidyverse

- To use ggplot2 functions, first load tidyverse
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

- In ggplot2 the structure of the code for plots can often be summarized as
```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot + 
  geom_xxx
```

or, more precisely
.small[
```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = [dataset], mapping = aes(x = [x-variable], y = [y-variable])) +
   geom_xxx() +
   other options
```
]

---

## About ggplot2

- ggplot2 is the name of the package
- The `gg` in "ggplot2" stands for Grammar of Graphics
- Inspired by the book **Grammar of Graphics** by Leland Wilkinson
- `ggplot()` is the main function in ggplot2
- For help with the ggplot2, see http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/

# Visualizing Star Wars

---

## Dataset terminology

.question[
What does each row represent? What does each column represent?
]

```{r message=FALSE}
starwars
```

---

## Luke Skywalker

![luke-skywalker](img/luke-skywalker.png)

---

## What's in the Star Wars data?

Take a `glimpse` at the data: 
```{r}
glimpse(starwars)
```

---

## What's in the Star Wars data?

Run the following **in the Console** to view the help
```{r eval = FALSE}
?starwars
```

![starwars-help](img/starwars-help.png)

.question[
How many rows and columns does this dataset have? What does each row represent? What does each column represent?
]

.question[
Make a prediction: What relationship do you expect to see between height and mass?
]

---

## Mass vs. height

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height=3}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

## What's that warning?

- Not all characters have height and mass information (hence 28 of them not plotted)

```
## Warning: Removed 28 rows containing missing values (geom_point).
```

- Going forward I'll supress the warning to save room on slides, but it's important to note it

---

## Mass vs. height

.question[
How would you describe this relationship? What other variables would help us understand data points that don't follow the overall trend? Who is the not so tall but really chubby ]

```{r fig.width = 6, fig.height=3, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

## Jabba!

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
jabba <- image_read("img/jabba.png")

fig <- image_graph(width = 2400, height = 1200, res = 300)
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point()
dev.off()

out <- fig %>% image_composite(jabba, offset = "+1000+30")

image_write(out, "img/jabbaplot.png", format = "png")
knitr::include_graphics("img/jabbaplot.png")
```

---

## Additional variables

Can display additional variables with

- aesthetics (like shape, colour, size), or

- faceting (small multiples displaying different subsets)

---

class: center, middle

# Aesthetics

---

## Aesthetics options

Visual characteristics of plotting characters that can be **mapped to data** are

- `color`

- `size`

- `shape`

- `alpha` (transparency)

---

## Mass vs. height + gender

```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=3.5, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass, color = gender)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

## Aesthetics summary

- Continuous variable are measured on a continuous scale
- Discrete variables are measured (or often counted) on a discrete scale

aesthetics    | discrete     | continuous
------------- | ------------ | ------------
color         | rainbow of colors | gradient
size          | discrete steps    | linear mapping between radius and value
shape         | different shape for each | shouldn't (and doesn't) work

---

class: center, middle

# Faceting

---

## Faceting options

- Smaller plots that display different subsets of the data

- Useful for exploring conditional relationships and large data

---

## Mass vs. height by gender

.small[
```{r fig.height=4, fig.width=8, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender) +
  geom_point()
```
]

---

## Dive further...

.question[
In the next few slides describe what each plot displays. Think about
how the code relates to the output.
]

---

```{r fig.height=4.5, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(gender ~ .)
```

---

```{r fig.width=7, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(. ~ gender)
```

---

```{r fig.height=4.5, fig.width=7, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ eye_color)
```

---

## Facet summary

- `facet_grid()`: 2d grid, `rows ~ cols`, `.` for no split

- `facet_wrap()`: 1d ribbon wrapped into 2d

---

## Height vs. mass, take 2

.question[
How are these plots similar? How are they different?
]

```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(80, 250) +
  ylim(0, 1400)
p2 <- ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  xlim(80, 250) +
  ylim(0, 1400)
suppressMessages(suppressWarnings(require(gridExtra)))
grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

---

## `geom_smooth`

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height, y = mass)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  xlim(80, 250) +
  ylim(0, 1400)
```

# Identifying variables

---

## Number of variables involved

* Univariate data analysis - distribution of single variable

* Bivariate data analysis - relationship between two variables

* Multivariate data analysis - relationship between many variables at once, usually focusing on the relationship between two while conditioning for others

---

## Types of variables

- **Numerical variables** can be classified as **continuous** or **discrete** based on whether or not the variable can take on an infinite number of values or only non-negative whole numbers, respectively. 

- If the variable is **categorical**, we can determine if it is **ordinal** based on whether or not the levels have a natural ordering.

# Visualizing numerical data

---

## Describing shapes of numerical distributions

* shape:
    * skewness: right-skewed, left-skewed, symmetric (skew is to the side of the longer tail)
    * modality: unimodal, bimodal, multimodal, uniform
* center: mean (`mean`), median (`median`), mode (not always useful)
* spead: range (`range`), standard deviation (`sd`), inter-quartile range (`IQR`)
* unusal observations

---

## Histograms

.small[
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```
]

---

## Density plots

.small[
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=4}

.small[
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(y = height, x = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Bar plots

.small[
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]

---

## Segmented bar plots, counts

.small[
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender, fill = hair_color)) +
  geom_bar()
```
]

---

## Segmented bar plots, proportions

.small[
```{r fig.width = 7, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data = starwars, mapping = aes(x = gender, fill = hair_color)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill") +
  labs(y = "proportion")
```
]

---

## Which bar plot is more appropriate?

.question[
Which of the previous two bar plots is a more useful representation for visualizing the relationship between gender and hair color?
]

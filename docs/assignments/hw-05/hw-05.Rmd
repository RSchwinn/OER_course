## Exercises

### Part 1: Simulations for hypothesis testing

Describe precisely how you would set up the simulation for the following 
hypothesis tests. Imagine using index cards or chips to represent the data. 
Also specify whether the null hypothesis would be independence or point and 
whether the simulation type would be bootstrap, simulate, or permute. In each 
of the scenarios you can assume sample size is 100 and number of simulations 
is 15,000.

1. Describe the simulation process for testing for a single population standard deviation. 
Suppose the research question is asking whether the standard deviation is less 
than 3, 
and the observed sample standard deviation is 2.
2. Describe the simulation process for testing for the difference between two 
population proportions. Suppose the sample proportion of successes for sample A 
is 0.3 and for 
sample B is 0.4.
3. Describe the simulation process for testing for a single population 
proportion. Suppose 
the research question is asking whether proportion of successes is majority, 
and also that 
the observed proportion of success is 0.6.
4. Describe the simulation process for testing for the difference between two 
population means. Suppose sample mean for sample A is 5 and for sample B is 3.

### Part 2: Inferring from the ACS

Each year since 2005, the US Census Bureau surveys about 3.5 million households 
with The [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/) 
(ACS). Data collected from the ACS have been crucial in government and policy 
decisions, helping to determine the allocation of more than $400 billion in 
federal and state funds each year. For example, funds for the Adult Education 
and Family Literacy Act are distributed to states taking into consideration data 
from the ACS on number of adults 16 and over without a high school diploma. 
This act is the primary source of federal funding for adults with low basic 
skills seeking further education or English language services, and Department of 
Education uses ACS data to ensure the efficient distribute funds.

The ACS received a surge of media attention in Spring 2012 when the House of 
Representatives voted to eliminate the survey.  Daniel Webster, a first-term 
Republican congressman from Florida, sponsored the legislation citing the 
following reasons:  

- "This is a program that intrudes on people's lives, just like the Environmental Protection Agency or the bank regulators" 
- "We're spending \$70 per person to fill this out. That's just not cost effective"
- "in the end this is not a scientific

In this part we use data from the 2012 ACS to answer a few questions about 
American adults. For each of the questions make sure to use the `infer` package 
in your answers and interpret your results in context of the data. For 
hypothesis tests make sure to state your hypotheses clearly. You can use 1,000 
repetitions in your simulations for computational efficiency reasons.

The dataset you will use is called `acs12` and it's in the `openintro` package.

5. Do these data provide convincing evidence of a difference in median income 
of employed Americans who do and do not speak English at home?

6. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the median travel time to work of 
Americans who are employed.

7. Do these data provide convincing evidence of a difference in the proportions 
of Americans who are employed between those who are citizens and those who are 
not?

8. Construct a 90% confidence interval for the difference in the proportions of Americans who are citizens between those who speak English at home and those who 
do not. 

9. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the difference for the difference in median incomes of employed Americans born in the first hal of the year vs. those born in the in the second half.

10. Pick your own: State a question you want to answer with these data and answer it using the appropriate inference method.

## Getting help

Use the #questions channel on Slack to ask questions.

- R errors/questions: Make a [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).
- Git/GitHub errors/questions: Clearly outline your steps that got you to the 
point you're in.

You are also welcomed to discuss the homework with each other broadly 
(no sharing code!) as well as ask questions at office hours.

## Grading

In addition to accuracy of your answers to questions, your submission will be 
evaluated for

- coding style,
- informatively named code chunks,
- commit after each question (at a minimum, more commits ok),
- informative commit messages,
- document organization, and
- quality of writing and grammar.

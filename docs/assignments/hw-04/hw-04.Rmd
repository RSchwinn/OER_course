But really, one is enough. Pick a package from the list below, and use it to do something. If you want to use a package not on this list, that's also ok, but run it by me first (so that I can confirm it's not one we introduce in class so far, the goal is to work with a new package).

## Package list

### Packages on CRAN

These packages can be installed with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("PACKAGENAME")
```

The package manuals are linked below, however developers of the packages might have additional information on the GitHub repo of the package.

- praise:
	- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/praise/praise.pdf
	- Build friendly R packages that praise their users if they have done something good, or they just need it to feel better.	
- GGally:
	- The R package 'ggplot2' is a plotting system based on the grammar of graphics. 'GGally' extends 'ggplot2' by adding several functions to reduce the complexity of combining geometric objects with transformed data. Some of these functions include a pairwise plot matrix, a two group pairwise plot matrix, a parallel coordinates plot, a survival plot, and several functions to plot networks.

- suncalc:
	- R interface to 'suncalc.js' library, part of the 'SunCalc.net' project <http://suncalc.net>, for calculating sun position, sunlight phases (times for sunrise, sunset, dusk, etc.), moon position and lunar phase for the given location and time.
	- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/suncalc/suncalc.pdf
- ttbbeer
	- An R data package of beer statistics from U.S. Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB)
	- https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ttbbeer/ttbbeer.pdf
	
### Packages GitHub only

These packages can be installed with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("USERNAME/PACKAGENAME")
```

`USERNAME` refers to the user name of the developer of the package. For example, for the first package listed below, `USERNAME` is `hadley` and `PACKAGENAME` is `emo`.

The package manuals are linked below, however developers of the packages might have additional information on the GitHub repo of the package.

## Getting started

Here are the steps for getting started:

- Start with an assignment link that creates a repo on GitHub with starter documents: https://classroom.github.com/a/QlPBWkcA
- Clone this repo in RStudio
- Make any changes needed as outlined by the tasks you need to complete for the assignment
- Make sure all your code chunks are informatively named, and these labels re not repeated
- Periodically commit changes (the more often the better, for example, once per each new task)
- Push all your changes back to your GitHub repo

and voila, you're done! Once you push your changes back you do not need to do anything else to "submit" your work. And you can of course push multiple times throughout the assignment. At the time of the deadline we will take whatever is in your repo and consider it your final submission, and grade the state of your work at that time (which means even if you made mistakes before then, you wouldn't be penalized for them as long as the final state of your work is correct).

## Assignment

Install the package you pick. Depending on where the package comes from, how you install the package differs:
    - If the package is on CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), you can install it with `install.packages`. 
    - If the package is only on Github (most likely because it is still under development), you need to use the `install_github` function. See above for details.

Then, load the package. Regardless of how you installed the package you can load it with the `library` function.

Finally, do something with the package. It doesn't have to be complicated. In fact, keep it simple. The goal is to try to read and understand the package documentation to be able to carry out a simple task.

## Exercises

1. Which package are you using? State the name of the package, whether it was on CRAN or GitHub, and include the code for loading it.
2. What are you doing with the package? Give me a brief narrative including code and output.

## Getting help

Use the #questions channel on Slack to ask questions.

- R errors/questions: Make a [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).
- Git/GitHub errors/questions: Clearly outline your steps that got you to the 
point you're in.

You are also welcomed to discuss the homework with each other broadly 
(no sharing code!) as well as ask questions at office hours.

## Grading

In addition to accuracy of your answers to questions, your submission will be 
evaluated for

- coding style,
- informatively named code chunks,
- commit after each question (at a minimum, more commits ok),
- informative commit messages,
- document organization, and
- quality of writing and grammar.
